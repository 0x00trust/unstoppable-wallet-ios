The BANK has been designed for everyone. You don't need to understand the inner technicalities of crypto currencies to be able to use it on daily basis and participate in this economy. Brwose all screenshots here, https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5b167c731d079e4122e946b7

## Independent & Decentralized

BANK wallet is fully peer-to-peer and works without any centrally managed servers. As a result it can't be stopped, blocked or taken down. The wallet connects directly to the currency networks i.e. Bitcoin using an SPV mode. Such technical approach enables the BANK wallet to operate anywhere and remain censorship-resitant as long as there is an internet connection. 

Because the wallet doesn't rely on any central servers it will continue working and allow users to access and spent funds at any time. 

It should be noted that a large majority of the crypto wallet apps out there don't really give users full control of their funds. Usually the funds are stored on a remote server operated and controlled by the wallet provider. This essentilly means that you have to REALLY trust a third party storing your funds because they have full control over your crypto funds. They can potentially steal your funds. Due to the unregulated nature of the cryptocurrencies there are no mechanisms in place to guarantee that your wallet provider doesn't cheat and tries to steal your funds. 

The BANK wallet on the other hand is trully independent! You and only you are in full control of the money on your balance.

## Secure & Open Source

The entire code of the wallet is open source giving an option for anyone to analyze all of its code. 

The BANK wallet stores user's private keys and funds encrypted on device using secure native storage mechanisms provided by iOS and Android oprating systems. Only user can access and use his or her funds. The wallet also provides an option to set an unlock PIN for an app as a precaution against the loss of your phone. 

In case of a device loss or replacement the user may easily restore the wallet using a secret 12-word recovery phrase. Infact, with the help of these secret phrase the user may restore the wallet and access funds on any deterministic wallet (aka HD wallet) not just the BANK wallet.

*NOTE* We DO NOT recommend installing our wallet on jailbroken devices due to substantial security risks. A jailbroken iOS/Android opearting systems are no longer secure and therefore can not securely protect your private keys. This means that an app running on jailbroken device can access wallet's private keys and steal your funds.
